# R6-Manager
Inspired by the Football Manager series of games, I've decided to develop a similar game concept but for the Rainbow Six Siege Pro Circuit. 

<h2>The Concept</h2>
There is a JSON file that contains all the information needed for an engine to simulate a match between two teams. A UI allows the players to create their own team, control tactics, buy and trade players, and everything else a manager would be required to do. The database would consist of information extracted from official matches and tournaments of the Tier 1 level. 

<h2>How to use this </h2>
The first thing I am going to build is the engine itself, at that point it would become available to run as a .exe file that will be released, then the data for the database will be collected and cleaned and placed into a JSON after which the UI will be developed in order to release a final product. For more information on the specifics of how this works, see my <a href = "blog.samagno3.com>blog</a> or <a href = "samagno3.com/#Projects">website</a>.
